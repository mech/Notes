> Quick pulls are a way to very easily go from editing a file to launch into a pull request. It is a nice simple flow thing that we've done to remove friction for your development.

> You have to zoom in and out between the general and the specific.

> A sculptor may sit down to sculpt something without a clear idea of the exact form it will take; sometimes we need to start pushing and pulling on the clay to see what comes out of it.

---

> All roads lead to a human-centered design approach, where the user is the prime focus. Often considered accessory or secondary, microinteractions actually create a feeling of well-being once they are discovered by users. As a designer, recognizing the invisibility of microinteractions is just as important as designing them. You have to create something that feels human and accomplishes a task.

> At this point I have one big problem: I have no idea what's going to happen when I hit share. I was really hesitant to tap the share button at first...what if my photo goes public? Can anyone see this? Sharing to where?

> Those are a lot of high-friction questions this early in the flow.

---

> High-level functions are easier to define if you have the whole UI printed out and intelligible at a glance. It’s also a lot easier to spot any duplications and inconsistencies that way. [The language of modular design](http://alistapart.com/article/language-of-modular-design)

> Having answers to these posed questions is an excellent place to start. Being a good designer—being a good visual designer — requires intentionality. That means that you're thinking through these questions and answering them as you're making design decisions, not only when someone asks you the question after the fact.
> 
The next thing to work on as you answer these questions with intentionality, is to ensure that intentionality is based on solid design principles and research and attention to detail, and yes, sometimes things like style and preference. This can be tricky, because not every designer has these sensibilities or well-founded opinions yet. And that's okay, because the path to improving this begins by understanding that your work isn't quite there yet. - [Intentionality](https://medium.com/facebook-design/how-to-make-your-not-so-great-visual-design-better-67972eee3825#.av1p86o44)

* Construct your page with **hierarchy**. Visual weight.
* Don't present data or information that is disconnected from the user's past experience with your brand or product. No one wants things to happen or appear randomly. Ambiguity will lose users.
* **Symmetry of interaction**. How you trigger is how you will will reverse the action. Activation and deactivation actions must be symmetrical.
* Interaction happens with the content. The content is the interface! The actions feel close to the objects being interacted with. How can we bring tools nearer to the content to make the interaction as lightweight as possible.
* Interfaces should strive to be mode-less. Soft mode is okay as it does not trap user in the mode.
* Easy to understand, easy to target (Fitts's Law), and quick to execute. This will make them feel lightweight.
* **No matter how cool your interface is, less of it would be better**
* Follow users' mental models
* Provide choices rather than ask questions
* Provide modeless feedback
* Design for the probable but anticipate the possible
* Contextualize information
* Reflect object and application status
* Avoid unnecessary reporting
* Elegance - Graceful way of solving a design problem
* Design is the process of taking the available data and coming up with its representation. See [Pure-UI](http://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui/)
* They want "fast" and "good-enough". Make boring UI.
* Computers are starting to outpace the computational abilities of our brains. The more we can do with a tool, the more the interface has to get out of the way. Sometimes, we can do so much with a tool, that we need the help of AI to unlock its full potential. This isn't just a simplification of interface; it's a complete shift in how we design our digital tools.
* When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
* A great designer knows how to work with text not just as content, he treats text as a user interface.
* Each section in your site needs to tell a story. It needs a reason and a final outcome for the user, The layout needs to help the content highlighting what are the most important pieces in that story. In reality there shouldn't be too many call outs on a page so everything should drive to that final "What can I do here".
* Satisficing - Sacrifice the "perfect" for "good enough" in order to conserve mental resources.
* Redundancy in cues is an asset, not a liability
* Pretty conceptual, but Scorekeeper does a great job of creating focus
* Creating focus
* Isolates modes
* Detailed & actionable
* Don't risk oversimplification.
* Be accurate and predictable
* Use progressive disclosure (esp. for expert user)
* Always think about your intent - the things you want a visitor to do. What is the "main" JTBD.
* **Anchor** a layout
* If you want someone to watch a video or register for an account, focus on making those elements shine. They don’t need to be the biggest items on the page, but they should have enough heft and visual prominence through placement and color to draw attention.
* Without contrast, we don't have hierarchy, and without hierarchy, the typography feels indistinguishable and our readers are left without a map.
* When we first glance at something, we tend to seek patterns; we mentally group similar elements and try to uncover a pecking order.
* "Keep your user informed about what is going on" - Jakob Nielsen
* Clean and simple with a bright and inviting color palette
* UI always reflect the user's current task. Unnecessary options are rarely presented to the user.
* Pay attention to clutter
* Simplify headlines
* Don't make user stare into the void. Have some CTAs ready. Suggest next steps and highlight features.
* We shape our tools and thereafter they shape us.
* On-boarding (first task), proactive suggestions for next steps, and moving the user from training wheels to deeper engagement.
* Nothing to install, nothing to configure—just **flow**.
* App's needlessly bespoke interface
* **Instant gratification!**
* Defer to content. Deference. Give content center stage. Design for experiences that are unobtrusive and reduce distraction to lend focus to the work at hand.
* Let your layout breathe
* Dominance - Lead the eye where to look first. Dominant, subdominant and subordinate. See [IBM Design: Layout](http://www.ibm.com/design/language/framework/visual/layout)
* Make the application frame/design modular so that it can accommodate different engagement/purposes in life.
* Keep elements that work the same looking the same to avoid distracting users with inconsistencies. Don't venture into cuteness.
* Don't make your UI so fatigue that user skip doing it
* Offer an opinion on your UI
* Making decision has a cost
* Use motion, not more content to show relationships. See Apple iOS motion.
* Use motion to tell micro-story.
* Design for flow, instead of screens. Too often we design for screens instead of study the exact flow. The unit of design is not screen. Think more in time-based manner. See Netflix UI.
* Create a language of time for your product. See Google Material Design.
* Design for time by designing with time-based tools.
* Give people perspective by orienting them in time. Everything is changing too fast. Let user has perception of passage of time. See Facebook Memory.
* Design product that last, and products that die.
* Recognition is easier than recall.
* Fewer border lines and background colors.
* Provide minimum user inputs
* Getting the right questions out is vastly more effective than trying to find the right answer.
* Sometimes the idea needs to be improved before the visual polish can be attacked.
* A tool addresses human needs by amplifying human capabilities. That is, a tool converts what we can do into what we want to do. A great tool is designed to fit both sides.
* Tell story, you are not designing screens or "lazy rectangles" - [The Perfect Design Tool](https://medium.com/user-defenders/the-perfect-design-tool-54e64428f2b#.f39n4mpia)
* The focus of the solution circles around human beings, rather than interfaces or apps.
* Adding a new feature doesn't just mean sticking it on top of the UI — you have to blend it with the existing design, with the user in mind. A feature needs to be added in a way that feels natural to the user. It can't be forced.
* Demonstrating value before asking for something - Value proposition.
* Human think in flow - See the UI Stack (Ideal State, Blank State, Partial State, Error State)
* How does the flow of the page "read"?
* Being a good designer - being a good visual designer - requires intentionality.

When it comes to the design of complex behaviors and interactions, we've found that focusing too early on pixel pushing, widget design, and specific interactions can get in the way of effectively designing a comprehensive framework in which all the product's behaviors can fit. Instead, we need to consider the big picture first and rendering our solutions in low-fidelity manner.

> Give user visual rewards. Guide them how to "work the system".

## Bounded Context

* [Bounded Context](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html)

> Various factors draw boundaries between contexts. Usually the dominant one is human culture, since models act as Ubiquitous Language, you need a different model when the language changes. You also find multiple contexts within the same domain context...

## UI is 90% Typography

* [Typography for UI](https://viljamis.com/2016/typography-for-user-interfaces/)
* [Web design is 95% typography](https://ia.net/know-how/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period)

## Conversational UI

* [Crafting a conversational design](http://uxcellence.com/2015/11/01/crafting-a-conversational-design/)
* [Bots vs Human](https://blog.intercom.io/bots-versus-humans/)

The future of UI is text.

> I think of the questions I would need to ask him to get some information, the orders I would give to get something done, the answers I would like to receive.
> 
> And I write the whole conversation out, following an order that makes more sense.

The interface was limiting us. We needed something with no interface.

Picking the right thing to say, and the tone of your dialogue with the user, is crucial.

> Conversational apps are therefore organized around the way I organize my life, rather than the way the app maker might dictate.

## Navigation

Always present less navigation links/options to user in order to stress focus. But metric should determine if more links/sections should be added.

* [The Obvious, the Easy, and the Possible](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3047-the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible)
* [Smart RWD when off-canvas isn't good enough](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/smart-responsive-design-patterns-or-when-off-canvas-isnt-good-enough/)

* Obvious - The obvious is all about features and navigation items that should always be within reach of the user. It reflects the essence of the website, and it is expensive because it requires pixels on the screen. Think about the most important sections or features of your website; if they belong to the obvious group, they should always remain visible.
* Easy - Beyond obvious, you'll find easy. The things that should be easy are the things that people do frequently, but not always. It all depends on your product, and your customer, but when you build a product you should know the difference between the things people do all the time and the things they do often. This can be hard, and will often lead to the most internal debates, but it's important to think deeply about the difference between always and often so you get this right.
* Possible - And finally are the things that are possible. These are things people do sometimes. Rarely, even. So they don't need to be front and center, but they need to be possible.

## Color Blindness

Do not only use color. Go for contrasts and shapes.

## Zero UI

Get rid of all the stuff in our UI, primarily is visual. Enjoy the content, not adjusting the settings.

Struggle to learn interface.

## Micro and Macro level

> "Individually dumb, but capable of surprisingly intelligent behavior when functioning as a group"

Component, isolated, dumb, simple, micro-level.

Application, parent, smart, complicated, macro-level.

## UI Refactoring and Expansion

* [**Product Design Debt - incrementally-developed UI that are never refactored often turn into a Las Vegas**](http://andrewchen.co/product-design-debt-versus-technical-debt/)

We must design UI for refactoring and possibility of expansion. This is hard to do. You cannot predict what new features you may add.

Important navigational areas like homepage, inboxes, notifications, etc are all the same way.

You want to avoid messy A/B tests and UX pollution.

The more diverse activities you have, the more little features you want to expose, the more you need to design flexible and adaptable UI. Make the navigation paradigms scalable.

## User Goals, Needs, Motivations, Behaviors, JTBD

*Design of behavior* is a different kind of problem that requires greater knowledge of *context*.

When companies *do* focus on users, they tend to pay too much attention to the *tasks* users engage in rather than the *goals* in performing those tasks.


## Goal-Oriented vs Activity-Centered Design


## Component Libraries

* [Multi-select](http://davidstutz.github.io/bootstrap-multiselect/)
* 


**Principles**

1. Make it direct
2. Keep it lightweight

## Discoverability vs Readability

We want to make UI naturally discoverable, but we also do not want to clutter the chrome with many buttons, CTAs, etc. This tension always exist and must be balanced out depending on context and current user's needs.

Visual noise is the number one concern for putting too much weight on discoverability.

Using another interaction as a teachable moment to guide the user to a richer interactions is a good way to solve discoverability issues. Look for opportunities for teachable moments in the interface leading users to advanced features.

> Showing tools would compete with the list itself. The tools actions may be important, but making the content clear and readable is a higher priority.

* Static Invitation
* Dynamic Invitation

## Microstates: Interesting moments

There are a number of individual states at which interaction is possible. We call these microstates *interesting moments*. It is the Microinteraction!

## Patterns

### Overlay

* For multiple-field editing
* Demand user's full attention
* If you don't need inline context while editing
* Use overlay when large number of fields needed to be edited
* When editing is not frequent
* For single entity

### Drop-down Editor

* [**You Know What? Fuck Dropdowns**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcYAHix-riY)

> Drop downs should be the UI of last resort - @lukew

* [**Tether**](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/docs/welcome/)

![d](UI_Patterns/drop_down_editor.png)

### Group Edit

Use when you have a list of items stacking together. Balance between visual noise and discoverability.

### Empty state, Skeleton, Blank Slate

* [Text Spinner](http://tawian.io/text-spinners/)
* [Tips for creating a blank slate](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/tips-for-creating-a-blank-slate)

## Lists

Anytime you have a list, you need to think about categorisation, grouping, filtering. Sooner or later, the list will become huge and unmanageable. You should study the information architecture of your lists of things and consider segmentation and categorisation.

### Autocomplete and Pick list


## Menu Buttons (Muttons)

* You have a default action, but alternate actions are still fairly frequent

## Pagination

* [Infinite scrolling vs pagination](https://uxplanet.org/ux-infinite-scrolling-vs-pagination-1030d29376f1#.y3k6noa5p)

## Multimodal

Modality? Human is very good at multimodalities. They switches modalities rapidly in order to multi-task and survive.
