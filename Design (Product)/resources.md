User research == Customer development

## Product Design

Product design is a set of problem solving processes and methods used to make better products for people everywhere.

Whether that product is physical objects or applications does not matter.

## Growth

* [33 ways to get more clients](http://clientflow.io/blog/33-ways-to-get-more-clients/)

## Wireframe and Prototyping

* [Streaming the design process: User flow to final design](https://medium.com/@wixelhq/streamlining-the-design-process-user-flow-to-final-design-using-sketch-ba71d2355bf9)

## Storyboard

Stories are broken into Epics. Epics has their main flow. Design the task flow with boxes and arrow? Then visualize the flow with prototypes/wireframes. Low-fidelity wireframes, then high-fidelity interactive prototype.

## Lean and MVP

* [MVP vs MDP](http://www.startupblender.com/minimum-viable-product-vs-minimum-delightful-product/)

Laser printer - Xerox trying to do too much and missed the boat. IBM beat them?

Intermingle with business and marketplace.

90% of startups failed.

Don't ask "Can you build it"! Ask "should you build it"!

Validate these:

* Problem - Is there a problem your app is solving? Is anyone care about that problem even? If so, validate it!
* Market - Are there enough people who have this problem and care about this problem?
* Product - Is our product solving this problem for this market?

Pager Study. Ask repeated questions. Don't use yes/no, opinion, or number questions. You won't learn much. Ask behavioral questions.

> Quantity can lead to quality - Lean. Execute. Don't overthink it.

> It's easy to fall in the trap to try to make your product "wow" instead of making your product more "of course". The moment you launch your product and see real users struggle with the interface you designed, you will understand "of course" is more important then "wow". - [No more hamburgers](http://blog.gibbon.co/posts/2014-04-03-no-more-hamburgers.html)
