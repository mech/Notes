# Tools

Design is a process best served by consistent, frequent feedback. It's about messy iterations, interdisciplinary collaboration, and problem-solving.

Design decisions don't live independently of business or engineering goals - their impact is deeply intertwined with how well a business performs.

## Prototyping

Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
